# GunGoPewPew3
pew pew


run main.exe to run


Basically funi game where you shoot "enemies" and stuff

A few notes:
  Controls for survival mode are mostly just the classic controls with a few changes:
  
    1. pressing g with grenade launcher will store it and pressing g again will take it out again
    
    2. minigun requires charge up so just hold down the spacebar
    
    The rest is pretty intuitive in my opinion
  Yes i spammed stalker/the division/decaying winter music
  
  Theres probably only gonna be 1 more version after this before i am done officially
  
  If theres any bugs in survival mode ill fix them next release

ok now go pew pew or something idk
